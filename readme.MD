# iCloud Photo Downloader + Converter

Have you been annoyed by Apple and how iCloud photos work?  Don't want to buy that pesky HEIC codec from the Microsoft store?  Me too.

This is a quick and dirty PySimpleGUI UI that allows you to authenticate to iCloud, choose a date, and then download all the photos and videos.  HEIC files get converted.

## Usage

1. Run the `main.py` script to start the application.

2. Click the "Sign in to iCloud" button and enter your iCloud username and password when prompted.

3. Use the calendar button to select a date. The application will download photos and videos taken on or after that date from your iCloud account.

4. Click the "Download" button to start the download process.
